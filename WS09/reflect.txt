I implemented reading and writing files. The data I wanted was in the form of "firstname, middlename, lastname" and "address, city, probince, postalcode," so I used getline() to read the input until I reached the end of the file.
example) getline(province, size of province, ¡®,¡¯ )
I dynamically assigned a character pointer type member variable to save the file. Writing or reading files was implemented by overloading operators. A write virtual function was called using an overload operator.
Dynamic allocation variables cause memory leaks. This is because the default copy creator or copy assignment operator performs shallow copies. Also, the destructor does not delete the allocated memory. 
For this reason, I safely copied the allocated memory and deleted it safely before shutting it down. Also, since the contact class is inherited from the personal class, I implemented the extinction as a virtual extinction.

The key to the this milestone was to properly understand the functions and classes previously implemented and to understand the inheritance relationship b
