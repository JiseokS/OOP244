//==============================================
Through this fourth week workshop, we learned and applied the use of constructor and destructor. To use the constructor, the constructor must first have no return value and can be overloaded and used. You can create a constructor that takes the parameter and inputs the value to the variable or set the default value to create a default constructor that inputs the set default value.
Destructor has the opposite function of the constructor. Destructor has the same form as the constructor and is marked with ~. Destructor prevents memory waste by erasing objects generated by the class. When dynamic memory is allocated, it must be dismantled after use.
Destructor example: delete[] m_name; delete[] m_city;
It is easier to distinguish when the name of the member variable and the name of the parameter are the same using the 'this' pointer. It can also be used to copy objects to other objects.
This example: return *this;    chapters[i] = this->chapters[i];
